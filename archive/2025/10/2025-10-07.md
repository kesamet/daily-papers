### Large Reasoning Models Learn Better Alignment from Flawed Thinking

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00938)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can learn better alignment by observing flawed human reasoning processes. The main objective is to determine if exposing LLMs to imperfect human thought chains, rather than just perfect ones, can improve their ability to align with desired behaviors. The researchers developed a novel framework where LLMs are trained on a dataset of human demonstrations that include both correct and incorrect reasoning steps, alongside final correct answers. Their findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances alignment, achieving a 15% improvement in a benchmark compared to models trained solely on correct reasoning. This suggests that incorporating diverse, even flawed, human reasoning can be a more effective strategy for aligning LLMs in practical applications.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00515)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** This paper introduces ProgCD, a novel progressive consistency distillation framework to improve the efficiency and performance of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

The main objective is to enhance the models' ability to recall and utilize less frequent information without degrading performance on common knowledge. The key methodology involves a two-component memory system: a global memory for common knowledge and a hierarchical local memory for long-tail knowledge, which are dynamically updated and accessed during pretraining. Experiments show that this approach improves performance on long-tail knowledge benchmarks, with a notable 12.5% increase in recall accuracy on a specialized long-tail QA dataset, while maintaining strong performance on standard benchmarks. This method implies that AI practitioners can develop more robust and knowledge-aware language models by explicitly managing and separating different types of knowledge during pretraining, leading to improved information retrieval and generation for nuanced and less common topics.

### Scaling Policy Compliance Assessment in Language Models with Policy Reasoning Traces

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23291)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper introduces a novel framework for scaling policy compliance assessment in language models by generating and utilizing policy reasoning traces. The research addresses the challenge of accurately evaluating whether language model outputs adhere to specified policies, especially in complex scenarios. The methodology involves a two-stage process: first, a policy reasoning trace is generated that outlines the policy application steps and relevant text spans; second, a verifier model assesses the compliance of the language model's response based on this trace. Experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves an average F1 score of 0.82 for policy compliance assessment, significantly outperforming traditional methods. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable method for AI practitioners to ensure language model outputs align with desired policy guidelines, enhancing trustworthiness and applicability.
