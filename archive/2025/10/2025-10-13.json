The primary objective is to improve the efficiency of exploration and policy acquisition in reinforcement learning environments by effectively utilizing this nascent data. The methodology involves a meta-learning approach where a dedicated 'teacher' agent, trained on diverse early experiences, guides the 'student' agent, enabling rapid learning and adaptation. A key result demonstrates that agents trained with this early experience framework achieve a 1.5x speedup in learning convergence and superior final performance compared to traditional methods across various tasks.
