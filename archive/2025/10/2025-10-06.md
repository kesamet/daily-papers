[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02314)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Computer Vision

**Summary:** StealthAttack proposes a novel adversarial poisoning attack against 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models, generating physically plausible 3D illusions. The objective is to inject imperceptible malicious 3D Gaussians into training data, causing a trained 3DGS model to render a target object (e.g., a duck) as a different object (e.g., a cat) when viewed from specific angles.

### Group-Relative REINFORCE Is Secretly an Off-Policy Algorithm: Demystifying Some Myths About GRPO and Its Friends

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24203)

**Authors:** Wenhao Zhang, Yushuo Chen, Yuchang Sun, Chaorui Yao, yanxi-chen

**Category:** Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:** This paper re-evaluates Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithms, identifying them as off-policy despite previous characterizations. The main objective is to clarify the theoretical underpinnings of GRPO and address misconceptions about its on-policy nature. The methodology involves a theoretical analysis demonstrating that GRPO's update rule is equivalent to an off-policy update using a specific importance sampling ratio, and is empirically validated through various tasks. Key results show GRPO can achieve stability and performance comparable to or exceeding on-policy methods, for example, achieving an average return of 850 in a MuJoCo task. This re-characterization implies that AI practitioners can leverage established off-policy analysis techniques and potentially integrate GRPO into off-policy frameworks for greater flexibility and efficiency.

### Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper re-examines preference semantics in arena-style LLM evaluations, focusing on the interpretation of 'draw' outcomes. The main objective is to identify and address the inconsistencies and ambiguities arising from different interpretations of draws, specifically distinguishing between 'tie' (equal preference) and 'undecided' (no strong preference). The methodology involves a human annotation study on 500 prompts with draw outcomes, categorizing them into these two types and analyzing their characteristics. The study reveals that a significant portion (75%) of draws are actually 'undecided', and treating them identically to 'ties' biases win-rate metrics by up to 2.5 percentage points. This implies that AI practitioners should implement more nuanced evaluation protocols that differentiate between 'tie' and 'undecided' outcomes to achieve more accurate and robust LLM performance assessments.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02272)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper explores the scaling laws of reasoning generalization across 25 diverse languages, an area often overlooked in large language model (LLM) research. The primary objective is to investigate whether the emergent reasoning abilities of LLMs, specifically Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, exhibit universal scaling laws that generalize across various linguistic contexts. The methodology involves conducting extensive experiments with a new Parallel Scaling Law benchmark, evaluating LLMs like BLOOMZ and mT5 on tasks such as arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning in both zero-shot and few-shot CoT settings. The key results indicate that reasoning generalization scales predictably with model size and data quantity, demonstrating a strong correlation (average Pearson R = 0.93 across tasks) between emergent abilities and model scale. The main implication for AI practitioners is the strong evidence that current LLM scaling laws transcend linguistic boundaries, suggesting that advancements in English-centric LLMs could translate to performance gains in other languages, simplifying multilingual model development strategies.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01796)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Machine Learning

**Summary:** This paper re-examines the conventional wisdom regarding the shape and structure of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The primary objective is to investigate whether the prevalent “pyramid” or “bottleneck” shape, common in deep learning architectures, is truly optimal or if alternative shapes can offer better performance. The authors explore various MLP shapes, including inverted pyramids and hourglass structures, through systematic experimentation on different datasets and tasks. Their findings indicate that non-conventional shapes, such as the inverted pyramid, can achieve competitive or even superior performance, with an example showing a 0.5% increase in accuracy on a specific benchmark compared to traditional designs. This research implies that AI practitioners should critically evaluate and potentially re-design MLP architectures beyond established conventions to optimize for specific tasks and resource constraints.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01123)

**Authors:** Ruan Silva, John Quan, Suchin Gururangan, Aniket Didolkar, Lovish Madaan

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper explores the novel concept of "thinking tokens" in Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their performance as improvement operators.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26313)

**Authors:** Bei Yu, Zhuolun He, Shoubo Hu, hywu, Yalimu

**Category:** Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:** This paper introduces One-Token Rollout (OTR), a novel policy gradient method designed to improve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs). The core objective is to bridge the performance gap between SFT and advanced reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) techniques by mitigating exposure bias and enhancing instruction following without full sequence rollouts. OTR utilizes a one-token lookahead to estimate future rewards and train a value function that provides a more accurate performance signal than cross-entropy loss. Experiments demonstrate that OTR-trained models achieve a 10.1% average win rate against SFT models on MT-Bench and AlpacaEval, while reducing training time by up to 50% compared to full RLHF. The method provides a more efficient and effective strategy for aligning LLMs with human preferences, offering a significant improvement over traditional SFT methods for practitioners.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00537)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Machine Learning

**Summary:** This paper investigates the spectral properties of feed-forward networks (FFNs) in large language models. The research aims to understand how FFNs utilize their latent space by analyzing the singular value distribution of their weight matrices.
