[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22921)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:** This paper re-examines Large Language Model (LLM) distillation through the lens of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). The primary objective is to develop a novel distillation framework that addresses the challenges of ensuring both high fidelity to the teacher model and adherence to safety or ethical constraints. The proposed methodology formulates distillation as an optimal control problem, leveraging a CMDP framework where the student model learns policies that maximize reward (teacher fidelity) while satisfying constraints on undesirable behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that this CMDP-based approach can achieve up to a 15% improvement in constraint satisfaction compared to standard distillation methods, without significant loss in performance on target tasks. This implies that AI practitioners can employ this framework to build more reliable and ethically aligned LLMs, particularly in sensitive applications where both performance and safety are critical.

The methodology involves a synergistic interplay between a reasoning module (AlphaZero-like) and a critic module (Socrates), where the reasoning module generates solutions and the critic evaluates and provides feedback, iteratively refining both components. This co-evolutionary process, leveraging self-play and a Socratic dialogue mechanism, enables the agent to progressively master intricate reasoning tasks. A key result demonstrates that Socratic-Zero achieves a 10% improvement in zero-shot task performance on the GSM8K benchmark compared to baseline methods, effectively reducing the dependency on large-scale supervised data. This implies that AI practitioners can develop more autonomous and generalizable reasoning agents, potentially mitigating the data-scarcity problem in complex problem-solving domains.

### DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** DepthLM introduces a novel framework for metric depth estimation by leveraging the robust capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the geometric constraints of a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) model. The primary objective is to enhance zero-shot metric depth estimation by adapting large pre-trained VLMs to this task, addressing the limitations of existing methods that often struggle with scale and diverse scenes without explicit metric supervision. The methodology involves fine-tuning a VLM (specifically, a LLaVA-1.5 7B model) on a diverse dataset of images paired with 3D models to learn depth-related visual reasoning, followed by a refinement process using an MVS module that enforces geometric consistency. Key results include a state-of-the-art zero-shot depth estimation performance on the Waymo Open Dataset, achieving a median absolute error of 1.76 meters and a root mean squared error of 3.82 meters, significantly outperforming prior methods. This work implies that practitioners can achieve high-quality metric depth estimates without extensive depth-specific datasets or model retraining, opening avenues for more generalized and adaptable 3D vision systems in robotics and autonomous driving.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24988)

**Authors:** Mohit Bansal, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Hyunji Lee, Vaidehi Patil, Hanqi Xiao

**Category:** Machine Learning

**Summary:** This paper introduces Generalized Correctness Models (GCMs), a novel framework for learning model-agnostic and calibrated correctness predictors. The primary objective is to accurately predict the correctness of any machine learning model's predictions by leveraging historical prediction patterns, without requiring access to the model's internal states. GCMs achieve this by using a small neural network trained on features derived from the model's outputs and a calibration technique to ensure reliability. Experiments demonstrate that GCMs achieve a 3-5x reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to baseline methods in predicting correctness, offering significantly better performance. The main implication for AI practitioners is the ability to enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of black-box models by providing reliable correctness estimates for individual predictions.

### Advancing Reference-free Evaluation of Video Captions with Factual Analysis

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16538)

**Authors:** Subarna Tripathi, Tz-Ying Wu, dipta007

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** This paper addresses the challenge of reference-free evaluation of video captions by focusing on factual consistency. The main objective is to develop an automated method for assessing factual errors in video captions without relying on human-written reference captions. The key methodology involves a multi-stage process: first, extracting visual concepts from video frames using object detectors and OCR; second, identifying factual assertions within the generated captions through dependency parsing and semantic role labeling; and third, comparing the extracted visual concepts with the factual assertions to determine consistency. Results show that their proposed Factual Consistency Score (FCS) correlates well with human judgments, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.68, and successfully identifies factual inconsistencies overlooked by traditional metrics. The primary implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a robust, automated evaluation metric that can guide the development of more factually accurate video captioning models, reducing the need for expensive human annotation in the evaluation phase.
