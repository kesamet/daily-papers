[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26625)

**Authors:** Yufan Ren, David Fan, Shengbang Tong, Junlin Han, koustuvs

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** This paper investigates the visual knowledge acquired by Large Language Models (LLMs) during their language pre-training phase, even without direct visual input. The research aims to demystify how LLMs develop visual priors, specifically exploring if these priors allow them to "see" before explicit visual fine-tuning. The methodology involves an in-depth analysis using various visual-language benchmarks and probing techniques, without introducing new visual training data. Key results indicate that LLMs possess surprising visual capabilities, achieving up to 60.5% accuracy on certain visual recognition tasks solely from language-based priors. The primary implication for AI practitioners is that leveraging these inherent visual priors can significantly reduce the need for extensive visual pre-training, potentially leading to more efficient and powerful multi-modal models.

### More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25848)

**Authors:** Fabian Waschkowski, Mengqi He, Zhaoyuan Yang, Shu Zou, Xinyu Tian

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** This paper investigates the complex relationship between reasoning capabilities and accuracy in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing a dual nature where increased reasoning steps do not always lead to improved performance. The primary objective is to understand if and when greater reasoning depth, often proxied by intermediate thought generation, correlates with higher accuracy in VLMs on various tasks. The authors propose a framework using two distinct strategies: 'thought-augmentation' which involves generating intermediate thoughts to guide the model, and 'thought-supervision' which fine-tunes models on these generated thoughts. Their findings indicate that thought-augmentation can surprisingly lead to a 2% decrease in accuracy on tasks requiring intricate reasoning, despite showing more explicit reasoning traces. This suggests that while reasoning is a critical component, its integration and application in VLMs require careful design, urging AI practitioners to consider the potential trade-offs and not solely rely on the presence of intermediate thoughts as a proxy for improved task performance.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25154)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper investigates the detectability of judgments generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to human-written judgments. The research aims to understand if LLM-generated evaluations can be reliably distinguished from human evaluations, a critical concern for automated assessment systems. The methodology involves conducting human evaluation studies where participants, including expert and non-expert annotators, judge the veracity and origin (human or LLM) of judgments across various NLP tasks, and also training machine learning classifiers for detection. Key results indicate that human evaluators struggle to differentiate between human and LLM-generated judgments, achieving only 50-60% accuracy, barely above random chance, while classifier performance is also limited. The primary implication for AI practitioners is the significant challenge in autonomously verifying the authenticity and reliability of LLM-generated content, suggesting caution in deploying LLM-based evaluators without robust verification mechanisms.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)

**Authors:** normanpaulsen

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper investigates the effective context window of large language models (LLMs) under real-world constraints. The main objective is to determine the maximum practical context length before performance degradation occurs due to factors like latency and cost. The methodology involves evaluating various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1) on tasks like needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, using different context lengths and assessing recall rates. Results indicate that while some models can handle up to 200k tokens, their effective recall sharply declines, with 128k context often showing less than 50% recall, highlighting a significant gap between advertised and practical capabilities. This implies that practitioners should be cautious about relying on very long context windows, instead focusing on optimized context and retrieval strategies for better real-world application performance.

**Summary:** This paper introduces CritPt, a novel benchmark designed to probe the critical point of AI reasoning, a concept analogous to phase transitions in physics. The primary objective is to evaluate AI models' ability to generalize and reason under minimal information conditions, akin to a phase transition point. The methodology involves a game-theoretic approach using multi-agent competitive games, where AI models must infer hidden rules and properties from limited observations. Preliminary results indicate that current state-of-the-art AI models, including GPT-4, achieve an average win rate of 30% against the optimal strategy in CritPt scenarios, highlighting significant limitations in their critical reasoning capabilities. The implication for AI practitioners is the need to develop new architectures and training paradigms that foster more robust and generalizable reasoning, particularly in environments with sparse information.

**Authors:** Jiaxin Zhang, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Becky Xiangyu Peng, Justin Chih-Yao Chen

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper investigates methods to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by exploring novel nudging techniques. The primary objective is to evaluate whether specific interventions in the prompt structure can enhance LLMs' performance on complex reasoning tasks, even without fine-tuning. The methodology involves applying various 'nudges,' such as self-correction, scratchpad, and reflection, to different LLMs and evaluating their impact on problem-solving accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Results show that certain nudges significantly improve accuracy, with some techniques achieving up to a 15% increase in performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks compared to baseline zero-shot prompting. The main implication for AI practitioners is that strategic prompt engineering and the incorporation of simple 'nudging' mechanisms can substantially unlock latent reasoning abilities in existing LLMs, leading to more robust and reliable AI systems without necessitating extensive model retraining.

### Convolutional Set Transformer

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889)

**Authors:** Giacomo Boracchi, chinefed

**Category:** Computer Vision

**Summary:** The paper introduces the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel architecture designed to process sets of images by integrating convolutional features with set-transformer mechanisms. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of standard set transformers when dealing with high-dimensional image data, which often results in prohibitive computational costs and a loss of spatial information. The CST achieves this by applying a convolutional backbone to extract features from individual images, followed by a set transformer operating on these feature maps, which are treated as sequences of patch tokens. This approach significantly improves performance, with CST achieving an F1 score of 0.963 on the MNIST-Clutter dataset and demonstrating competitive results on other benchmarks like CelebA. The primary implication for AI practitioners is the provision of an efficient and effective method for set-to-set prediction tasks involving image data, enabling better handling of permutation invariance while retaining crucial spatial details.

### Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810)

**Authors:** Zhaoran Wang, Bowen Jin, Yihao Feng, Donghan Yu, Shenao Zhang

**Category:** Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:** This paper introduces a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that treats reasoning as an action abstraction. The main objective is to enhance the scalability and efficiency of deep RL agents during mid-training by using learned action abstractions. The methodology involves a two-phase training process: initially, a base policy is trained with basic actions, followed by a mid-training phase where a reasoning module generates macro-actions (action abstractions) which are then fine-tuned via an RL objective, specifically using a PPO algorithm. The primary results demonstrate that agents trained with this method achieve an average 15% improvement in sample efficiency compared to baseline methods and outperform agents trained without abstractions by achieving higher average returns in complex environments. This approach implies that AI practitioners can significantly accelerate the training of deep RL agents and improve their performance in complex decision-making tasks by strategically introducing and learning action abstractions during the training process.

### LLM Watermark Evasion via Bias Inversion

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23019)

**Authors:** Jungseul Ok, Sangdon Park, Jeongyeon Hwang

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper introduces a novel method called "Bias Inversion" to evade watermarks embedded in large language models (LLMs). The research objective is to develop an effective strategy for watermark evasion without significantly degrading text quality. Bias Inversion operates by identifying the LLM's inherent biases from its token distributions and then generating text that systematically inverts these biases, thereby circumventing watermark detection. Experimental results demonstrate that Bias Inversion achieves an average watermark detection accuracy of 0.05, significantly lower than baseline methods, while maintaining a perplexity score of 8.2 on tested datasets. This implies that AI practitioners should be aware of the vulnerability of current LLM watermarking schemes to sophisticated evasion techniques like Bias Inversion.

### GeoRemover: Removing Objects and Their Causal Visual Artifacts

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18538)

**Authors:** Chunming Qiao, He Wu, Xuelu Feng, Haoxiang Li, Zixin Zhu

**Category:** Computer Vision

**Summary:** GeoRemover addresses the challenging problem of removing objects and their causal visual artifacts from images, which is critical for realistic image editing. The paper's objective is to develop a method that effectively handles geo-causal artifacts such as reflections, shadows, and occlusions, which traditional object removal techniques often fail to address comprehensively. GeoRemover introduces a novel framework that integrates geometric reasoning to identify and remove these artifacts by analyzing scene depth and object interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoRemover significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 25% improvement in visual fidelity metrics on complex scenes. This advancement implies that AI practitioners can achieve more photorealistic and artifact-free image manipulations, enhancing applications in virtual try-on, augmented reality, and content creation.

### Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16944)

**Authors:** 

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** This paper introduces a Self-Distilled RoI Predictor (SDRP) to enhance fine-grained perception in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The core objective is to overcome the limitations of MLLMs in localizing and understanding small, fine-grained regions within images by providing more precise region-of-interest (RoI) proposals. SDRP employs a two-stage distillation approach: first, it distills knowledge from an off-the-shelf object detector into a lightweight RoI predictor, and then it self-distills knowledge from a stronger, teacher MLLM to further refine the RoI predictor's capabilities. This method significantly improves MLLM performance on fine-grained tasks, achieving a 7.2% absolute gain on the Visual Genome Dense Captioning task. The primary implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a practical and effective method to boost the fine-grained perceptual abilities of MLLMs, making them more suitable for applications requiring detailed visual understanding.
