### FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207)

**Authors:** XingtaiHF, yuxinzuo, Dinghuai, daixuancheng, xuekai

**Category:** Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:** FlowRL proposes a novel method to enhance large language model (LLM) reasoning by aligning the reward distributions between an LLM's intermediate reasoning steps and an expert policy, particularly using an MCTS-based expert. The main objective is to overcome issues like reward sparsity and sensitivity to policy updates in direct policy optimization for LLMs. The key methodology involves training a reward model to match the value function of an expert policy and then using this trained reward model to guide the LLM's reasoning process via a policy gradient approach. Results demonstrate that FlowRL significantly improves performance, achieving up to a 10% gain over baselines on reasoning tasks, even with a small fraction of expert demonstrations. The primary implication for AI practitioners is a more efficient and stable way to fine-tune LLMs for complex reasoning by leveraging expert guidance without needing extensive expert trajectories for direct imitation.
