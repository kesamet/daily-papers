        "summary": "This paper introduces Discrete Noise Inversion (DNI), a novel technique for controllable, text-based image editing by extending diffusion models with next-scale autoregression. The primary objective is to enable fine-grained image manipulation using text prompts while maintaining image quality and consistency, addressing limitations of existing diffusion models in multi-turn editing. DNI achieves this by converting continuous noise into a discrete latent representation and then autoregressively diffusing new content at a finer scale, guided by text. Experiments demonstrate DNI's effectiveness, achieving a 56% improvement in text-image alignment compared to baseline models and producing high-quality edits with enhanced control and less computational overhead. This approach provides AI practitioners with a robust framework for developing more interactive and precise image editing tools, particularly useful in content creation and design applications."

        "summary": "This paper investigates the theoretical limitations of embedding-based retrieval systems. The core objective is to determine whether these systems can achieve perfect recall for sufficiently large and diverse datasets, specifically focusing on the expressivity of embedding functions. The methodology involves theoretical analysis and construction of counterexamples, demonstrating that for a given embedding dimension d, there exist datasets with more than 2^d distinct items where perfect recall is impossible. The primary result shows that even with infinite precision, the recall is bounded by a quantity related to the dataset size and embedding dimension, falling to 0.5 for datasets exceeding the embedding capacity. The main implication for AI practitioners is that increasing embedding dimension is crucial for maintaining high recall in large-scale retrieval systems, highlighting an inherent trade-off between dimensionality and retrieval performance."

The main research objective is to bridge the gap between these two distinct notions of fairness, which are often studied in isolation, by proposing a unified framework. The key methodology involves introducing the concept of \"individual fairness via group fairness,\" where individual fairness is achieved by satisfying group fairness across appropriately defined, fine-grained groups. Primary results include the demonstration that achieving fairness for sufficiently small groups (epsilon-groups) can approximate individual fairness, quantified by a theoretical bound showing that an individual can be misclassified by at most epsilon when group fairness is maintained for all epsilon-groups. The main implication for AI practitioners is that by rigorously defining and ensuring group fairness at a granular level, they can systematically achieve a quantifiable degree of individual fairness in their models, thus providing a practical pathway to more equitable AI systems."
