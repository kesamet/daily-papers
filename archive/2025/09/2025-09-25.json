The primary objective is to determine if high-dimensional proprioceptive information, beyond just end-effector pose, is crucial for learning effective visuomotor policies. The authors propose a methodology that compares policies trained with varying levels of proprioceptive input (full, end-effector only, and none) across different robotic manipulation tasks. Key results indicate that policies without proprioceptive states perform comparably to those with full proprioception, achieving success rates within 5% of each other on tasks like pushing and picking.

The methodology involves evaluating various vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) using both soft and hard prompts on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, analyzing their accuracy and sensitivity to context. The study finds that while soft prompts can perform comparably to hard prompts on ID data (e.g., achieving 85.5% accuracy on ImageNet), their performance significantly degrades on OOD data, often underperforming hard prompts by substantial margins (e.g., up to 20% on certain OOD benchmarks like ImageNet-A).
