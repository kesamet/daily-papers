This is achieved via a variational autoencoder-like structure that learns a latent action space and then projects these continuous actions to discrete motor commands for a robot, demonstrating a novel approach to action modeling. Experimental results, including 91.6% success rate on navigation tasks, show significant improvements over baseline methods in robot manipulation and navigation, particularly in complex, long-horizon tasks.
