The methodology involves evaluating various post-hoc explanation techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) on differentially private NLP models, using metrics like faithfulness and comprehensibility to quantify the quality of explanations. Results indicate that increasing privacy budgets, while enhancing privacy, often leads to a significant decrease in explanation fidelity, with some methods experiencing a drop in faithfulness by over 20% in certain differentially private settings compared to non-private baselines. The main implication for AI practitioners is the crucial trade-off between privacy and explainability, necessitating careful consideration of privacy mechanisms' effects on explanation quality when deploying NLP systems."
