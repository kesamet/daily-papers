### Chain-of-Agents: End-to-End Agent Foundation Models via Multi-Agent Distillation and Agentic RL

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13167)

**Authors:** Liam-Liu, hugteste, kangz, wanwan1212, tianyue818

**Category:** Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:** This paper introduces Chain-of-Agents (CoA), an end-to-end framework for developing agent foundation models. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of existing agent models, particularly their reliance on static, single-turn human data and their inability to generalize to complex, multi-turn reasoning tasks. CoA employs a novel multi-agent distillation (MAD) process to extract knowledge from powerful proprietary models and combines it with agentic reinforcement learning (RL) using human feedback (RLHF) for iterative refinement. The authors demonstrate that CoA significantly improves performance, achieving an average gain of +15.6 on unseen tasks compared to baseline models, highlighting its superior generalization and instruction-following capabilities. This work implies that agent developers can leverage multi-agent interactions and RL techniques to build more robust and generalizable AI agents for complex reasoning and decision-making scenarios.
