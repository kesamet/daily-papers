### Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819)

**Authors:** Jiaqi Wang, Yuhang Cao, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Jinsong Li

**Category:** Natural Language Processing

**Summary:** This paper introduces a variable-length denoising strategy for diffusion large language models (LLMs) to address their fixed-length generation limitation. The core objective is to enable more flexible and effective text generation by allowing the denoising process to adapt to different sequence lengths. The authors propose integrating a length-conditional mechanism and a novel training objective that accommodates variable-length outputs within the diffusion framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves text generation quality, achieving a 15.3% perplexity reduction on the WikiText-103 dataset compared to fixed-length counterparts. This approach offers AI practitioners a more robust and adaptable method for developing diffusion-based LLMs capable of generating diverse and high-quality text.
