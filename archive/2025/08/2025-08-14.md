**Summary:** This paper introduces a novel text-conditioned state space model (TSM) for domain-generalized change detection visual question answering (CD-VQA), a task that combines visual change detection with natural language understanding. The primary objective is to enable the model to answer free-form questions about changes between two images, even when facing domain shifts, by leveraging text prompts to guide the visual analysis. The key methodology involves integrating a text-conditioned state space model, which processes both visual and textual inputs through a dual-path mechanism using an encoder-decoder structure for effective cross-modal feature learning. Experimental results on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, AICD, and CD-VQA) demonstrate that TSM outperforms existing methods, achieving a notable 6.95% accuracy improvement on the CD-VQA dataset. This work implies that AI practitioners can develop more robust and adaptable visual question answering systems by effectively incorporating text conditioning into state space models, especially for tasks requiring generalization across diverse visual domains.

### Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)

**Authors:** Ayberk Cansever, Seyed Hadi Seyed, incrl

**Category:** Computer Vision

**Summary:** This paper introduces a novel approach to improve masked style transfer, specifically addressing the limitations of existing methods in handling large masked regions. The research focuses on integrating a Blended Partial Convolution (BPC) layer into the network architecture to enhance image quality in synthesized regions. The key methodology involves using the BPC layer to progressively complete missing information within masked areas, rather than relying solely on adversarial training. Quantitative results show that models incorporating BPC layers achieve a significantly lower L1 reconstruction loss of 0.003 compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The main implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a more robust and effective method for style transfer in scenarios with substantial occlusions or missing data, leading to higher fidelity image generation.

### NVSpeech: An Integrated and Scalable Pipeline for Human-Like Speech Modeling with Paralinguistic Vocalizations

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04195)

**Authors:** Haoyue Zhan, Yiheng Lu, Yuancheng Wang, Qinke Ni, Huan Liao

**Category:** Multi-Modal

**Summary:** NVSpeech is a novel, integrated speech synthesis pipeline capable of generating human-like speech with diverse paralinguistic vocalizations. The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems by incorporating realistic non-verbal sounds. It employs a multi-stage approach, including an automatic speech recognition (ASR) based prosody and paralinguistic tagger, a speech encoder for context, and a diffusion-based vocoder. The system achieves a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for naturalness of 4.30, demonstrating high perceptual quality. This innovation provides AI practitioners with a robust tool for creating more expressive and natural-sounding synthetic speech for various applications.
